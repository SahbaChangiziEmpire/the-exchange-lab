# API Usage
The backend component provides the following API endpoints:

- PUT /api/employees/:employeeId: Update the name of an employee
- PATCH /api/employees/:employeeId/remove: Remove an employee from a position
- POST /api/employees/create-and-assign: Create a new employee and assign them to a position
- GET /api/organization: Fetches the organization hierarchy from the database
- POST /employees/positions: Add a new manager position to the organization hierarchy

Here is an example of how to use the `/api/employees/:employeeId` API endpoint to update an employee's name:

Request:

    PUT /api/employees/1 HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe"
    }
In this example, we are sending a PUT request to the `/api/employees/1` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the firstName and lastName of the employee we want to update.

Response:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "message": "Employee name updated successfully"
    }
This response indicates that the update was successful.

Similarly, here is an example of how to use the `/api/employees/:employeeId/remove` API endpoint to remove an employee from their position:

Request:


    PATCH /api/employees/1/remove HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
In this example, we are sending a PATCH request to the `/api/employees/1/remove` endpoint to remove the employee with an ID of 1 from their position.

Response:


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "message": "Employee removed from position successfully"
    }
This response indicates that the removal was successful.

Finally, here is an example of how to use the `/api/employees/create-and-assign` API endpoint to create and assign a new employee:

Request:

    POST /api/employees/create-and-assign HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "positionId": 1,
        "employeeNumber": "1234"
    }
In this example, we are sending a POST request to the `/api/employees/create-and-assign` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the firstName, lastName, positionId, and employeeNumber of the new employee.

Response:


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "message": "Employee assigned successfully"
    }
This response indicates that the creation and assignment were successful.

# Automated Testing
The testing approach for the application involved the use of the Supertest library, which provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP applications. The testing suite includes unit tests for the API endpoints, and each test case makes a request to the API and verifies that the expected response is received. The tests ensure that the application meets the specified requirements and that it can handle errors and edge cases.

To run the tests, simply navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:


    npm test
This command will execute the test suite, and the results will be displayed in the console. Alternatively, you can run individual test files by specifying the path to the file:


    npm test test/employees.test.js
The test results are displayed in a clear and concise format, indicating whether each test passed or failed. Additionally, the tests generate reports that provide more detailed information about the test results, including the number of tests run, the number of tests passed, and the time taken to run the tests.

Before running each test suite, we set up a test database and insert sample data into the database that is specific to each test suite. This ensures that each test is run on a clean and consistent data set. We use the beforeAll hook to run this setup code.

After each test suite is executed, we tear down the test database using the afterAll hook to ensure that any changes made to the database during the test run are discarded.

We use the supertest library to send HTTP requests to our application and make assertions about the responses. Each test suite includes multiple test cases, each of which tests a specific functionality of the API endpoint being tested. We use the it function to define each test case.

We also make use of the expect function provided by the Jest testing framework to make assertions about the response received from the API. These assertions ensure that the API behaves as expected in different scenarios. We test both successful and error cases to ensure that the API handles errors correctly.

Overall, the testing approach was effective in ensuring the quality and reliability of the application. The tests provide a high level of confidence that the application is functioning as expected and that it is capable of handling a variety of inputs and scenarios.

Below is the sample output of test execution:

# Design Decisions
The following design decisions were made when building this application:

The frontend component was built using the `Material-UI` library to provide a consistent and modern look and feel.
The backend component was built using Express to provide a lightweight and flexible framework for building RESTful APIs.
A PostgreSQL database was chosen for storing the organization hierarchy data, due to its strong data modeling capabilities and support for complex queries.
The API was designed to be simple and easy to use, with clear and concise endpoints that map to specific actions in the application.

# Trade-offs

One potential trade-off in the design of this application is the choice between scalability and complexity.

On one hand, the current design of the application is relatively simple and easy to understand, making it easy to develop and maintain. However, as the application scales and more features are added, this simplicity may become a limitation.

To maintain scalability while keeping the application simple, it may be necessary to introduce more advanced technologies and architectural patterns, which could increase the complexity of the application.

Another trade-off to consider is the balance between performance and data consistency. For example, the current implementation of the API may prioritize consistency by requiring more database operations for certain requests. This may impact performance, particularly when handling large volumes of requests. Alternatively, a more performant implementation may prioritize speed over consistency, potentially leading to data inconsistencies under certain conditions.

Ultimately, the design choices made for this application depend on the specific needs of the organization and its users. By carefully weighing the trade-offs of each design decision, the application can be optimized for the best possible user experience while also ensuring long-term scalability and maintainability.
